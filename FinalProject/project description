-----Final Project Title-----
    Data Analysis Using Cluster: Time, Agencies and Recipients With Funding Taxpayers Paid to the U.S. Government  
    
-----Project outline-----
This project aims to find the relationship between time, agencies and recipients with funding taxpayers paid to the U.S. Government. 
The difference between action date and last modified date indicates the efficacy of the government, 
and we want to know if the speed is associated with any agency, any party in the office or the amount of transaction funding. 
The second question we want to know is which agencies have the money and which agencies ended up spend the money. 
Moreover, we want to further analyze the recipients of each transaction.	

-----Data and Methods-----
Use UC Davis STA141C cluster to grab the original data, apply parallelism processing to import and further clean the data. 
Both Python and R are used for further analysis including applying group by computation, apply family functions and object oriented programming, etc.

-----Improvements could have been done-----
    1. Use the more representative portion of data
    2. Deal with plot sizes and qualities
    3. Find better model than regression model
    
-----Notice that partial code files are posted. For detail code, see appendix under the report.-----
