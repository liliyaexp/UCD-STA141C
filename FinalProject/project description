This project aims to find the relationship between time, agencies and recipients with funding taxpayers paid to the U.S. Government. 
The difference between action date and last modified date indicates the efficacy of the government, 
and we want to know if the speed is associated with any agency, any party in the office or the amount of transaction funding. 

The second question we want to know is which agencies have the money and which agencies ended up spend the money. 

Moreover, we want to further analyze the recipients of each transaction.
